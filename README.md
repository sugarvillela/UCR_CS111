# UCR_CS111-Javascript
UCR CS111 is Intermediate Discrete Structures.  These algorithms are in Javascript.

Though it's not really a programming class, I found it helpful to code the given algorithms for better understanding and memorization.

This repository contains Javascript code for:
1. RSA decryption (Homework problem included)
2. Integer Partitioning (With high bounds, low-bounds, ranges, OR's of lower bounds)
3. Cardinality using inclusion/exclusion principle
4. Paths in an adjacency matrix, using matrix multiplication
5. Euclid's GCD algorithm, with extended algorithm for linear combinations
