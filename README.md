# UCR_CS111
UCR CS111 is Advanced Discrete Structures.  These algorithms are in Javascript.

Though it's not really a programming class (there are no programming assignments) I found it helpful to code the given algorithms for better understanding and memorization.

This repository contains Javascript code for:
Encryption
Integer Partitioning
Cardinality
Paths in a Graph.
